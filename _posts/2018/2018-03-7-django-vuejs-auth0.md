## Introduction to Webpack
 
In this section we you briefly get introduced to Webpack (and why you should use Webpack?)

Essentially  webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications which becomes a fundamental tool with the rise of modern JavaScript front end frameworks  such as Angular, React and Vue. It also can be easily configured to bundle other assets such as HTML, CSS and images via loaders. It will help you reduce the number of requests and round trips to your web servers, use modern standards such as ES6 and allows you to use npm modules in your front-end apps.  

Webpack basically works by processing your application then builds a dependency tree which contains all modules used by the application and finally bundles all those modules into one or multiple bundles (depending on your configuration)

Webpack offers a plethora of features to bundle static assets  (JavaScript, CSS, images etc.) for front-end web developers such as:

- the splitting of dependencies into chunks
- the support of a plethora of plugins
- it's highly [configurable](https://webpack.js.org/configuration) 
- it's heavily customizable
- it's very flexible thanks to [loaders](https://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-loaders.html)
-  you can interface with Webpack either from its [CLI](https://webpack.js.org/api/cli) or [API](https://webpack.js.org/api/node).

![](https://webpack.github.io/assets/what-is-webpack.png)

Webpack has four core concepts [entry](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/entry-points), [output](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/output), [loaders](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/loaders) and [plugins](https://webpack.js.org/api/plugins)

The [entry](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/entry-points/) property allows you to define the entry point(s) for your Webpack configuration. It can either be a single string value, an array of values or an object.

The [output](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/output/) property allows you to define the information Webpack needs to write the bundled file(s) to the drive such as the filename and the path (minimum two properties)

[Loaders](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/loaders/) are powerful feature of Webpack as they are used  to teach Webpack how to transform assets from other languages than JavaScript such as TypeScript, CSS, Sass etc.  

[Plugins](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/plugins/) are used to extend Webpack of anything beyond what can be achieved using loaders.

Webpack is a powerful tool that, once mastered, can help you  to  improve your front-end development workflow.


## Vue Webpack Configuration

In this section we will briefly talk about the Webpack configuration for Vue 

Vue uses its own file format with the extension `.vue` for encapsulating the HTML,CSS and JavaScript code (using `<template>, <style>, and <script>` tags respectively) to construct components. You can also add your custom blocks.

Vue supports the custom file format by using its own loader. `vue-loader` parses the `.vue` files, extract blocks inside the top-level tags (`<template>, <style>, and <script>` and possibly custom tags) then convert them to CommonJS modules.   

You can also use languages that need pre-processing such as Sass or template languages that compile to HTML such as Jade by simply adding the *lang* attribue to a language block (for example `<style lang="sass"></style>`)

The Webpack boilerplate (that you have used to scaffold the Vue project using the Vue CLI `vue init webpack vueapp`)  can be used for large projects. It's based on  `vue-loader`  and assumes you are familiar with Webpack.

This is the structure of your Vue application based on Webpack 

![Vue application](https://screenshotscdn.firefoxusercontent.com/images/25b68082-de0c-450f-bb2b-5d392d948f7c.png)


There are many folders and files in the project such as:

`package.json`: this is the npm file that holds meta information about the package (such as the name, description, author and license etc.). This file also holds the name and version of every dependency that the package/project uses  and custom build commands. 

`index.html`: this is the main HTML file for the Vue single page application. This file is generated in the *dist* folder both in development and production builds and links to all generated assets will be injected in this file (you can use it to run your Vue application but since you are going to build your own template for Django that will dynamically injects the static assets using Django Webpack loader you don't actually need this file)

`src`: this one is obviously the source folder of your Vue application. Most development will take place inside this folder because it's where the actual application code lives.

`build`: this folder contains the Webpack configuration files for development and production i.e  `webpack.dev.conf.js` and `webpack.prod.conf.js`. This is where you are going to work in order to fix Hot Code Reloading and also to instruct Webpack to generate `webpack-stats.json` file using a plugin.

`build/config`: this is the configuration folder that holds configuration settings for development and production. You are not going to touch this folder in this part but you'll be using it in the next part to set some variables required for production such as *assetsPublicPath*

`static`: this the static folder, don't be confused by its name! It's only used to put static assets that don't need to be processed by Webpack. The files in this folder will be copied as-is where the other assets are generated.

### The Application Demo

In the previous part you have started building the Django and Vue demo. You have generated both the front-end application with the Vue CLI and the Django project. You also added JWT authentication via Auth0 then setup the front-end to connect to the back-end and made a basic call that's secured with Auth0.   

In this second part you will continue building the demo application by integrating both the front-end application and the back-end application. Basically you want to make Django serve the Vue application so you'll need to make Django able to know about the static assets Webpack generates and also update Webpack configuration to fix HCR (Hot Code Reloading) of the Webpack Dev Server. 

## Integrating Vue and Django 

In this section I'll show you step by step how to integrate Vue and Django 

First  head over to your terminal or command prompt then you'll need to clone the project we have previously built 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/techiediaries/djangovue 
```

You can also skip this step and just continue with the project you have built yourself in the previous part.
 
Please note that you need to have your previously created virtual environment activated before you install Django packages.

You can activate a virtual environment by issuing the following command

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

Where *env* is the name of the virtual environment. 

I assume that you have previously followed the steps in the part 1 to install the Django packages. if this is not the case use `requirements.txt` to install the requirements

```bash
cd djangovue
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

You also need to install the Vue app dependencies, navigate inside the `frontend` folder and execute:

```bash
npm install
``` 

Next run the following command to install the Webpack loader package for integrating Webpack with Django

```bash
pip install django-webpack-loader
``` 

Then go to your project `settings.py` file and  add `webpack_loader` to `INSTALLED_APPS` :

```bash
INSTALLED_APPS = [
	#...
	'webpack_loader',
    'catalog',
    #...
]
``` 

Next you need to add the following object to `settings.py` to configure the Webpack loader

```bash
WEBPACK_LOADER = {
    'DEFAULT': {
        'BUNDLE_DIR_NAME': '',
        'STATS_FILE': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'webpack-stats.json'),
    }
}
```

This tells Webpack loader to look for  `webpack-stats.json` in the root folder of the project. This file holds information about the static assets that Webpack has generated (you will see next how to generate this file). 

### Serving the Index Template

Now you need to create and serve an `index.html` file, where you can mount the Vue application, using a Django view

First create the `index.html` template in `catalog/templates/index.html` then add the following content.

```html
{ % load render_bundle from webpack_loader % }

<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Django - Auth0 - Vue</title>
    
</head>
<body>
<div id="app">
</div>
{ % render_bundle 'app' % }
</body>
</html>
```

The page contains a `<div>` with the id *app* where you can mount the Vue application.

The `render_bundle` tag (with *app* as an argument) is used to include the *app* bundle files.

After creating the template, you can next use *TemplateView*  to serve it. Go to your project `urls.py`` file then add the following:

```bash
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from django.views.generic import TemplateView
from django.conf.urls import url

from catalog import views

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^api/public/', views.public),
    url(r'^api/private/', views.private),
    url(r'^$', TemplateView.as_view(template_name='index.html'), name='index'),    
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]

```


Now reload your Django application, you will get the Yellow page with an error with Django complaining about not finding the `webpack-stats.json` file needed by the Webpack loader.   

>Error reading /xxxx/xxxx/xxxx/django-auth0-vue-part-2/webpack-stats.json. Are you sure webpack has generated the file and the path is correct?

This is a screen shot of the error that you will get

![Django error](https://screenshotscdn.firefoxusercontent.com/images/00877402-e1c0-4551-b5a4-94e655238791.png)

To get rid of this error you need to generate the `webpack-stats.json` file using  the Webpack plugin `webpack-bundle-tracker` so first install it from npm using (make sure you are inside the Vue application):

```bash
cd frontend 
npm install webpack-bundle-tracker --save
``` 

In `frontend/build/webpack.dev.conf.js`  import `webpack-bundle-tracker` and include *BundleTracker* in Webpack plugins

```
const BundleTracker = require('webpack-bundle-tracker')
/*...*/

  plugins: [
    /*...*/
    new BundleTracker({filename: '../webpack-stats.json'})
  ]
```

This tells `webpack-bundle-tracker` to generate the stats file in the root folder of your project.

If you re-run you Webpack dev server, you'll have the `webpack-stats.json` file generated in root of your project   

![webpack-stats.json](https://screenshotscdn.firefoxusercontent.com/images/89eab56a-d9d4-4952-bee9-4bc435036e09.png)

If you visit you Django app now you'll get this error in the console

>Loading failed for the `<script>` with source “http://127.0.0.1:8000/app.js”.
	
You can fix this error by going to `frontend/config/index.js` next locate the `assetsPublicPath` setting and change its value from `/` to `http://localhost:8080/`

```js
/*...*/
module.exports = {
  dev: {

    // Paths
    assetsSubDirectory: 'static',
    assetsPublicPath: 'http://localhost:8080/',
    proxyTable: {},
    /*...*/
```

Next rerun your frontend app using

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should now be able to see your main Vue page by navigating with your browser to http://localhost:8000

![main Vue page](https://screenshotscdn.firefoxusercontent.com/images/5f1ade34-ccd1-40ba-8d2b-c4cd47a0c7ab.png)

### Fixing Hot Code Reloading 

This is what the [docs](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/en/features/hot-reload.html) says about Hot Code Reload:

>"Hot Reload" is not simply reloading the page when you edit a file. With hot reload enabled, when you edit a *.vue file, all instances of that component will be swapped in without reloading the page. It even preserves the current state of your app and these swapped components! This dramatically improves the development experience when you are tweaking the templates or styling of your components.

![Hot Code Reload](http://blog.evanyou.me/images/vue-hot.gif)

Now in `frontend/build/webpack.dev.conf.js` you need to configure the Webpack Dev server to accept requests from other origins such as `http://localhost:8000` since the Django server will send XHR requests to `http://localhost:8080` for getting the source file changes.

Add a *headers* object in *devServer*. 
```javascript
  devServer: {
    headers: {
      'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '\*'
    },
  },
```

This will fix Hot Code Reloading when using Django server to serve Vue files. To test that, just change something in your Vue application and you'll be able to see your web page hot reloaded to see the changes without having to manually reload it.

That's all you need to do. Now re-run the Vue dev server then navigate with your browser to  `http://localhost:8000/`. You'll be now able to interact with your application served from the Django dev server.

### Updating Auth0 Callback URL

Previously you have used the Auth0 authentication from page served from the Vue server. So if you click the *Login In* button you'll will be redirected to this *Callback URL mismatch* page 

![Callback URL mismatch](https://screenshotscdn.firefoxusercontent.com/images/6b3e53db-bb71-45ab-a3ea-cd1e06fbe6d1.png)

Because now you are using the Django server to serve that page so you'll need to update (or add the Auth0 callback URL ) to `http://localhost:8000/` to make the authentication works

![Auth0 callback URL](https://screenshotscdn.firefoxusercontent.com/images/77f72018-2cc5-4649-891b-ebf7499153ff.png)

You also need to set this address in your `frontend/src/auth/AuthService.js` file as `redirectUri`

```js
  auth0 = new auth0.WebAuth({
    domain: '<YOUR_DOMAIN>',
    clientID: '<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>',
    redirectUri: 'http://localhost:8000/',
    audience: '<YOUR_AUDIENCE>,
    responseType: 'token id_token',
    scope: 'openid profile'
  });
```

Now you'll be able to authenticate using Auth0 to see this page and make a private API call

![make private API call](https://screenshotscdn.firefoxusercontent.com/images/6112ae65-db0b-49d0-99b9-1400aa444fb7.png)


## Conclusion

In this second part you have integrated your Vue application with Django so you can now use your web application by navigating with your browser to http://localhost:8000 the address of Django development server (Django is now serving the Vue application instead of just exposing API endpoints). 

In development you still have to run and use the Vue/Webpack dev server so you have seen how to fix Hot Code Reloading so you can still have your web page hot reloaded even if you are using the Django server address.

In the next part you will further continue developing the demo application by creating Vue views and wire them using the Vue Router for the front end. For the back end you will see how to create API endpoints using Django REST framework and see how you can prepare this setup (Django and Vue) for production.
