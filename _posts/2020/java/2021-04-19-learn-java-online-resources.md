So, you are thinking about learning Java. Since it’s fault-tolerant, high performing, and straightforward, the language is a great choice for beginners. However, navigating the waters of learning Java programming is by no means easy - there are a lot of resources to choose from, and it’s hard to tell the good and “meh” ones apart.

Fear not - in this short guide, we will walk you through the best books, courses, and online communities that’ll give you confidence and a sense of direction in Java learning.

## 5 Top Tips For Learning Java Online

If you are a Java self-learner, it’s easy to lose the drive early on since there’s no professor or test to hold you accountable. To make sure you’ll persevere, follow these 5 simple study tips.

-   Stock up on patience. Learning programming is a long road - it takes beginners up to three years to become fluent Java coders. That’s why it’s wise to not expect quick gains and celebrate small wins, such as learning and knowing how to apply the basic syntax.
-   Start with the basics. Self-learners often make the mistake of studying concepts too deeply when they don’t have the level of mathematical and CS expertise needed to grasp their full meaning. To make sure you don’t fall into the same trap, have a clear study plan. Here’s our suggestion:

-   OOP.
-   Java Core.
-   Java Syntax.
-   Collections.
-   Exceptions.
-   Multithreading and patterns
-   Lambda expressions.

-   Learn by doing. Coding is about practice - make sure you apply theoretical concepts to real-life projects as early as possible. There are a lot of coding games and practices to help you practice - we’ll go over the best ones below.
-   Be an active Java community member. When you learn a language, immersion is key - the same is true in coding. Do learn Java but take your time to read as much about Java as you can - join Reddit boards and Slack channels, skims through blogs, and try to get a general understanding of news and version updates.
-   Join study groups. There’s a saying that goes “If you want to go fast - go alone, if you want to go far - go together”. Having study partners is vital since you’ll have people to share small victories and struggles with, ask for advice, and hold yourself accountable.

## Top Resources to Learn Java Online

The right attitude is the stepping stone towards succeeding at learning a programming language. However, you can only put your drive to good use, if you have a solid base of resources to fall back on.

In Java’s case, there are a lot of books, videos, and courses beginners can use to get the feel of the language. Here’s our review of the best resources.

### Best Java Courses For All-Level Learners

-   Developers can [learn Java online on Codegym](https://codegym.cc/) with challenge-based tutorials and practice tasks. These are useful both for beginners and advanced programmers. It’s an engaging online course that covers Java Core, Syntax, Multithreading, Collections, and frameworks.
-   [Java Language Fundamentals](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/java-fundamentals-language) - It is another beginner-oriented resource (this time on Pluralsight) worth considering. Other than explaining the syntax, the course covers server-side development and Android programming.

### Best Java Books For All-Level Learners:

-   [Head First Java](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Java-Kathy-Sierra/dp/0596009208&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1618859371612000&usg=AOvVaw06xFbaCpHMW5DlzSor1264). It’s a must-read for Java beginners since the book succinctly covers Java Core. Advanced learners can use Head First Java for reference on I/O, networking, or swing.
-   [Effective Java](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0134685997&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1618859371613000&usg=AOvVaw1WVzvPnNGtDI9X6HhNMpgx). This book is a level higher than Head First Java. Although it doesn’t give beginners such a refined explanation of the basics, it’s a great resource for learning conventions and best practices.
-   [Java Performance](https://www.amazon.com/Java-Performance-Definitive-Guide-Getting/dp/1449358454&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1618859371614000&usg=AOvVaw2xtrm2ApxGfZi77-X5KCjS) is an advanced book that helps advanced coders make the most out of JVM. It covers garbage collections, internals, profiling, JVM tuning, and other concepts.
-   [Head-First Object-Oriented Analysis and Design](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Object-Oriented-Analysis-Design/dp/0596008678&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1618859371614000&usg=AOvVaw05R5fOIPaMwwJ-GR8yBRQJ). From the creators of the Head First series, this book is an enjoyable glimpse into the world of OOP design practices - preference for interface over implementation, DRY, and others.

## Bottom Line

When learning Java online, the main problem you’ll be facing is the lack of motivation and direction. The first one is easy to solve by joining online communities and participating in Java-related discussions.

The second one takes more time to deal with - set some time aside to research various books and courses, and you’ll find the list that matches your needs.
